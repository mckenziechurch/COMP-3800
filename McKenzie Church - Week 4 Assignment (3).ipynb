    "#### Week 4 Assignment\n",
    "**1.** What are the key steps of a data cleaning pipeline? State why each step is important and what would be the consequence of missing that step.  10 points \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "*1. Drop Unwanted Features*: This is necessary to drop features that aren't trivial to the goal of the project/assignment and wouldn't affect any outcomes that are needed. Missing this step would cause data results to be skewed, which could result in incorrect data being shown and evaluated. This could cost a business lots of money with incorrect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Address Missing Values*: Missing values need to be address in order to not report unfinished or unknown data, which may also skew the data. This is important because null or empty values will clutter the data and skew outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Remove Duplicates*: Removing duplicates is needed to not report on the same instance multiple times, as this may result in incorrect results when evaluating the data. These need to be removed in order for each datapoint to be unique in the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Fix Structural Errors (Features w/ Wrong Data Types)*: This is necessary in order to use the feature to evaluate the data. For example, an entry that is a string where it is supposed to be an int will cause errors further on, and may cause difficulty in pinpointing the issue when the error occurs. It is also essential to create uniformity in reporting the data, and in cases where the data needs to be translated into a different format, such as from database to boxplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Check Valid Inputs for Categorical Features*: This is necessary to ensure that all data is uniform and can be used easily, rather than worrying about different formats for data in the same category. For example, string data being in both lowercase and uppercase may cause later errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Identify Numerical Outliers*: Identifying outliers is needed to evaluate normalities within the data and can be used to identify causes for outlier cases. It is also necessary so that the data within the normal range isn't skewed based on these outliers, since they are special cases."
